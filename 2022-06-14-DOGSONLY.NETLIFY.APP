To Whom It May Concern:

 

My name is Benjamin <redacted>, I am the exclusive rights holder for content that is appearing on Netlify’s platform.

 

A Netlify subdomain “DOGSONLY.NETLIFY.APP” is being used to programmatically obfuscated and conceal rampant, systemic, ongoing copyright infringement conveyed on Netlify’s platform.

 

The infringing material is programmatically obfuscated using Netlify’s subdomain and actuated by referral traffic from Facebook:

A separate DMCA take-down request accompanies each count of infringement. For this records, this email represents count #2016, Exhibit ID NETLIFY-2016.

 

This is the second notice you have received regarding the same offender and the same URL. This is also the third time Netlify has been notified of copyright infringement farms operating on its platform by the same party.

 

If the infringing content conveyed via DOGSONLY.NETLIFY.APP is not removed,  I will consider this as proof of willful intent to commit copyright infringement and Netlify will be liable for the infringement. I strongly recommend you consult legal counsel.

 

Sincerely,

Benjamin <redacted>
