Dear Abuse Agent: 

On behalf of Robinhood Markets, Inc. (“Robinhood”), we are writing to you in your capacity as the service provider for [0xrobinhood.net](0xrobinhood.net). Our client is the proprietor of the popular online financial services and commission-free investing company located at https://robinhood.com. Robinhood owns numerous trademark registrations and applications for the ROBINHOOD® mark throughout the world, including U.S. Reg. Nos. 4,761,666, 4,774,375, 5,166,750, 5,290,074, and 6,739,186. Robinhood is also the proprietor of the globally recognized feather logo, U.S. Reg. Nos. 4,761,664, 4,761,667, and 4,859,177 for use in connection with its services (collectively, the “Robinhood Marks”). 

We recently learned that the website located at[0xrobinhood.net](0xrobinhood.net) (the “Infringing Website”), for which you are the service provider on IP: 104.196.30.220, 185.199.111.153, 75.2.60.5, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, 185.199.108.153, is using the Robinhood Marks to operate a website that is designed to look like Robinhood and asking for customer credentials, in what appears to be a phishing attempt. To conduct this fraudulent scheme, the website operator is using the Robinhood Marks in a manner that is identical and confusingly similar to Robinhood’s use of its Robinhood Marks. As a result, users are likely to be confused into believing that the website is sponsored, endorsed by, or associated with Robinhood, when that is not the case, and the Robinhood Marks are likely to be diluted and tarnished. 

We therefore request your assistance in deactivating the Infringing Website to stop the infringement of the Robinhood Marks. 

We provide this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief that Robinhood’s rights are being infringed by the operator of the Infringing Website. Under penalty of perjury, we certify that the information contained in this notice is both true and accurate, and we have the authority to act on behalf of the owner of the Robinhood Marks. 

Should you wish to discuss this matter further, please reply to this email. Thank you for your assistance. 

Nothing contained in this letter constitutes an express or implied waiver of any rights, remedies, or defenses of Robinhood, all of which are expressly reserved. 

Sincerely,
