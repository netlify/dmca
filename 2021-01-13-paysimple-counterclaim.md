Having read and understood the Netlify’s guide to filling a DMCA counter – and after investigation of the copyright claim, we wish to state as follows:

1. That the following URL – www.paysimple.ng does not in any way infringe on the copyright of the claimant as claimed.

2. This is because – as can be seen from our attached certificate of incorporation – we are duly registered as PAYSIMPLE TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED – to carry out business legally in the NIGERIAN MARKET.

3. As can been, the said website – ww.paysimple.ng – has a Nigerian TLD – having presented our Nigerian certificate of incorporation to our registrars and satisfied the requirements to legally operate in Nigeria.

4. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled. This is so because the claimant has not provided a valid justification of jurisdiction to prevent our use of the name PAYSIMPLE in the Nigerian market – which is our primary market.

5. I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where Netlify is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.
