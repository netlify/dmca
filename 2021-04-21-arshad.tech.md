I have read and understand Netlifyâ€™s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

This site is a hosting a copy of my blog (with my name removed) via Netlify (checked via curl)

My post:

Copy post on their site:

https://arshad.tech/2021/04/07/problem-with-nodejs-http-server/

This is a specific example, but all the other pages on the site are copied as well.
They must take down the content.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
