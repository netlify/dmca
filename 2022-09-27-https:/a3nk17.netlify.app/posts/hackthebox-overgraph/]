Create DMCA file for ticket 110912
To whom it may concern,

I have read and understand Netlify’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

My name is <redacted>, and I write frequently on my personal website (hosted on Netlify at <redacted>). Everything I post on my website is written and translated by me, and I reference other websites when it is required. Hence, the contents are my intellectual property.

The copyrighted content that I want to protect is an article at <redacted>. And the website that has copied everything from my personal website is <redacted>. One can check that the contents are the same (text, images, code blocks…). Even, there are some examples and images where my nickname (“rocky”) appears, so it is clear that the user called “a3nk17” has copied the contents from my website.

The user builds his website using Jekyll and GitHub. The specific file that infringes is <redacted> (branch called “gh-pages”).

I have contacted the user via email (taken from his GitHub profile, <redacted>), telling him to remove the contents on August 24th. It has been a month and he has not replied, and obviously, the blog post is still public and unchanged.

The user “a3nk17” must remove the article from his personal website hosted on Netlify (probably, removing it from his GitHub repository).

You can contact me:

Email: <redacted>
Name: <redacted>
Telephone number: <redacted>
Physical address: <redacted>

The alleged infringer’s email is  <redacted>, but he did not reply to me. His GitHub account is <redacted>.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Please, let me know if you need more information about the issue.

Yours faithfully,

Roberto
