Kinesis Labs represents in good faith and to the best of its knowledge that the aforementioned material has been removed or disabled.

Kinesis Labs response to this complaint is as follows:
The complaint does not follow the prescribed form for notification of an alleged copyright violation as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Specifically, the complainant has failed to:
- Provide the URLs for the specific files on Kinesis Labs’ website that are allegedly infringing.

If the complainant has links to any alleged copyright infringements, the complainant can email said links to Kinesis Labs, who will take it down immediately. Kinesis Labs has also taken down all images on our website at the time of the notice and replaced them while our team investigates.

Kinesis Labs consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which its address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where Netlify is located), and Kinesis Labs will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.


Thank you,
Kinesis Labs
