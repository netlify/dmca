Create DMCA file for ticket 134084
Hello!

To get started: I have read and understand Netlifyâ€™s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I recently discovered that jeremycaldwell.dev has taken all of my personal website's code, ryanmulligan.dev, and put it on their domain.
Only the main homepage heading and subheading strings have been altered, from what I can tell. OG images, CodePen projects, blog content, and even the footer copyright still contain my information.
I discovered the site through a google search of "layout breakouts". ryanmulligan.dev still appears first in the results, but jeremycaldwell.dev follows just underneath it.
I posted about the incident on mastodon here and later received a direct message telling me that the site in question is currently hosted on Netlify.
My assumption is that the owner cloned my site's public repo, attempted to use it as a starter template, but hasn't really touched it since deploying.
The last published blog post is from Oct 7th, 2022 as seen on the homepage. They don't include my blog posts written after Jan 20th, 2023, so I imagine they copied the site sometime between the two.

Some relevant WHOIS information for this domain shows that it is currently hosted on Google domains. I sent an email to the registrar abuse contact email listed below on February 18th. I have not heard back yet.

Domain Name: jeremycaldwell.dev
Registry Domain ID: 4A3456878-DEV
Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.google.com
Registrar URL: domains.google
Registrar Abuse Contact Email: <redacted>

Let me know if there is any other information that I can provide.

Thanks all!
Ryan
