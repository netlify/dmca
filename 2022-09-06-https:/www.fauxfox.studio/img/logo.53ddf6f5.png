Please respond to this message within 24 hours either by confirming that you have removed the allegedly infringing content or by providing a counter-notice as described below. Please note that we are required by United States law to take prompt steps to remove or disable access to the reported content, which may include suspension of your account. Also, repeat infringement of copyrighted works, as determined by AWS, can lead to account termination. We therefore request you attend to this matter immediately.
