Hello,

This is to confirm that your complaint has been received and reviewed.

In order to avoid any misunderstanding, we would like to inform you that Namecheap is currently providing only registration services for the domain name in question. It means that we cannot take down the content hosted by a third party as we do not have access to servers where the content is actually located.

To have the content disabled, it is advised to contact either a website administrator or the hosting provider company.

You are welcome to find the contact details of the company that owns the IP address currently assigned to the domain name below:
https://whois.domaintools.com/52.204.121.99

If you would like to contact the domain holder, you are welcome to use the email address listed for the domain in public Whois. If the contact details are hidden by the WHOIS protection service, feel free to send your email to the protected email address (like ****.protect@withheldforprivacy.com). It will be forwarded to the real email address of the domain holder. Please note that we do not guarantee that you will receive a response from our clients as we cannot force them to enter into email correspondence.

Also, note that the contact details of the domain owner may be hidden due to the GDPR. For more information, refer to https://gdpr-info.eu.

Please be informed that per our policy, Whois contact information protected by the WithHeldForPrivacy protection service can be revealed only based on an official request from a court (refer to https://www.namecheap.com/legal/general/court-order-and-subpoena-policy.aspx).

Thank you for understanding.
